        <span id="middle">The President of the Board of Control for Cricket in India is the highest post at
             the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), which administers cricket in India.
             [4][5] Though the post is an honorary one, it is considered a highly prestigious post due
              to popularity of the game in the India and the financial clout of the organisation.[6] 
              Over the years influential politicians, royalty and businessmen have occupied the post of President.[7] 
              The president is elected at the BCCI's Annual General Meeting by the member associations of the BCCI with 
              the outgoing president also getting a vote as the chairman of the meeting.[8]
             The post is rotated zone-wise amongst the five zones of BCCI and a person can hold the p
             ost of BCCI president for a maximum of three years.[9]

            In case of a vacancy, as per the Supreme Court of India, the most senior BCCI vice-president and the joint
             secretary would take over the interim roles of president and secretary respectively till fresh elections are held.
             [10] In its report in January 2016, the three-member Lodha Committee recommended the creation of the post of the CEO,
              with panel stressing the need for the BCCI to separate its governance and management duties, with the CEO taking 
              charge of the management side and also made recommendations for a clear segregation of operational duties from the 
              governance and policy-makers in the board.[11] In April 2016, Rahul Johri was appointed first ever chief executive
               officer of BCCI.[12]
